# Gut-Microbiota-and-Physical-Activity

## ABSTRACT 
Although gut microbiota is known to act as a bridge between dietary nutrients and body's energy needs, the interactions between gut microbiota, host energy metabolism and exercise capacity remain uncertain. Here, we characterized the gut microbiota ecosystem in a cohort of healthy normo-weight humans with heterogeneous exercise capacities (from inactive to elite endurance athletes). While our data support that the bacterial ecosystem appears to be modestly altered between individuals with low to high exercise capacities and close food habits, we report that gut bacterial Î±-diversity, density, and functional richness are significantly reduced in athletes with very high exercise capacity. By using fecal microbiota transfection (FMT), we report that the engraftment of gut microbiota from the athletes with very high exercise capacity improves insulin sensitivity and muscle glycogen stores into transfected mice, which highlights promising therapeutic perspectives in fecal transplantation from human donors selected based on exercise capacity parameters.
